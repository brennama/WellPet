WellPet, a pet budget making Android native app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

This app aims to help users understand and manage the costs associated with pet care through a simple and user-friendly interface. While existing budgeting apps are abundant, those specific to pet expenses are scarce. By focusing solely on pet-related expenses, the app provides a clearer and more focused experience for users. Essential features include user account creation, pet profile creation, and budget creation.
